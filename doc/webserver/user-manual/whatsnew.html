    <p><span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy 3.0.31</span> fixes two security issues that were discovered while preparing
    the 3.0.30 release. The issues also affect earlier Privoxy releases.</p>
    <p>Changes in <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy 3.0.31</span> stable:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Security/Reliability:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Prevent an assertion from getting triggered by a crafted CGI request. Commit 5bba5b89193fa.
            OVE-20210130-0001. Reported by: Joshua Rogers (Opera)</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Fixed a memory leak when decompression fails "unexpectedly". Commit f431d61740cc0.
            OVE-20210128-0001.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Bug fixes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Fixed detection of insufficient data for decompression. Previously Privoxy could try to decompress a
            partly uninitialized buffer.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Changes in <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy 3.0.30</span> stable:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Bug fixes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Check the actual URL for redirects when https inspecting requests. Previously Privoxy would only check
            the path which resulted in rewrite results being rejected as invalid URLs. Reported by withoutname in
            #1736.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Let the hide-referrer code tolerate Referer headers with https:// URLs. Previously they would always be
            treated like a changed host.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Use the https headers if the show-request handler is reached through https://. Previously Privoxy would
            use the http headers which may be empty on a reused connection.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Make CGI_PREFIX protocol-relative when building with FEATURE_HTTPS_INSPECTION. This unbreaks (at least)
            https://config.privoxy.org/client-tags whose buttons would previously use a http:// URL resulting in
            browser warnings.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Support using https-inspection and client-header-order at the same time. Previously Privoxy would crash.
            Reported by: Kai Raven</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Properly reject rewrites from http to https as they currently aren't supported. Previously Privoxy would
            wait for the client to establish an encrypted connection which obviously would not happen.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>When https inspection is enabled and Privoxy has been compiled with FEATURE_GRACEFUL_TERMINATION (not
            recommended for production builds), the TLS backend resources are free'd later on and only if no active
            connections are left. Prevents crashes when exiting "gracefully" at the wrong time.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Let the uninstall target remove the config file even if DESTDIR is set and properly announce the
            deletion of the configuration files.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>General improvements:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Allow to rewrite the request destination for https-inspected requests behind the client's back. The
            documentation already sort of claimed that it was supported by not especially mentioning that it didn't
            work for https-inspected requests. Fixes SF bug #923 reported by withoutname.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Add support for filtering client request bodies by using CLIENT-BODY-FILTER filters which can be enabled
            with the client-body-filter action. Patch submitted by Maxim Antonov. Sponsored by: Robert Klemme</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Add the new action suppress-tag{} which can be used to prevent a tagger from adding a tag. Patch
            submitted by Maxim Antonov. Sponsored by: Robert Klemme</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Gracefully handle existing website keys without matching certificates. This can happen if Privoxy was
            previously running with an invalid TLS configuration that didn't allow it to create a certificate.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Recycle debug bit 4 for Tagging-related messages.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Improve the message shown when the client-tags CGI page is requested with no tags configured.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Shorten the 'donate' and 'participate' links used by templates using redirects. Currently the redirects
            lead to the FAQ entries but in the future we may want to relocate the content and using redirects makes
            this more convenient.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Log an error when a PCRE-HOST-PATTERN is used with FEATURE_PCRE_HOST_PATTERNS disabled. Don't treat this
            a fatal error so the regression tests can be used with and without FEATURE_PCRE_HOST_PATTERNS.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The code compiles with older C compilers again.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The chdir() return code is checked to fix a compiler warning.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The packages feed has been removed from the source tarball. It's usually out of date when the source
            tarball is generated for the release.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Fixed harmless compiler warnings from GCC9 with -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>windows: Remove obsolete '$(DEST)/doc/images' target.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>windows: Install the images referenced in the user manual.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Remove obsolete 'gnu_regex.@OBJEXT@' target.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>When installing from the GNUMAkefile, don't create an 'images' directory which is no longer used. The
            images were relocated to the user-manual directory years ago.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Add new FEATURES to the show-status page and resort list.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Remove unused variable in the OpenSSL-specific code.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Update bug tracker URL in cgi_error_unknown().</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Saved a couple of memory allocations when sorting client headers.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Improved a couple of error messages.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Saved memory allocations when using OpenSSL and checking if a key already exists.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The configure script will bail out if OpenSSL and mbedTLS are enabled at the same time.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Log a message right before exiting gracefully.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>A couple of structures have been rearranged to require slightly less memory.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>When https inspection is enabled and the certificate is invalid the error message is now sent with
            status code 403 instead of 200.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The Slackware rc script template has been renamed to slackware/rc.privoxy.in to silence complaints when
            building Debian packages.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>When building with MbedTLS support, mbedtls_md5_ret() is used instead of mbedtls_md5() which is
            deprecated and causes a warning on Debian GNU/Linux.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Action file improvements:</p>

          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Filter file improvements:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>A allow-autocompletion filter has been added which changes autocomplete="off" to "on" on input fields to
            allow autocompletion. Requested by Jamie Zawinski in #370. Filter based on a submission by Aaron
            Linville.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Added an imdb filter.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Added a sourceforge filter that reduces the amount of ads for proprietary software.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Added a github filter that removes the annoying "Sign-Up" banner and the Cookie disclaimer.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Removed a duplicated pcrs command from the js-annoyances filter.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The crude-parental filter now provides a short reason when blocking, inserts a link to Privoxy's
            webinterface and adds a new line at the end of the generated page.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Privoxy-Log-Parser:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Highlight a few more messages.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Add a handler for tagging messages.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Properly deal with 'Certificate error' crunches Previously the error description was highlighted as
            'host'.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Log truncated LOG_LEVEL_CLF messages more gracefully and note that the statistics will be imprecise.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Fixed perldoc typo.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Bump version to 0.9.2.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Privoxy-Regression-Test:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Use http://127.0.0.1:8118/ as default Privoxy address unless http_proxy is set through the
            environment.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Add a --privoxy-cgi-prefix option that specifies the prefix to use when building URLs that are supposed
            to reach Privoxy's CGI interface. If it's not set, http://p.p/ is used, which is supposed to work with the
            default Privoxy configuration. If Privoxy has been built with FEATURE_HTTPS_INSPECTION enabled, and if
            https inspection is activated with the +https-inspection action, this option can be used with
            "https://p.p/" provided the system running Privoxy-Regression-Test has been configured to trust the
            certificate used by Privoxy. Note that there are currently two tests in the official
            regression-tests.action file that are expected to fail when using "https://p.p/" as privoxy-cgi-prefix.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Skip the connection-established response in get_status_code() when looking for the status code with a
            CGI prefix that starts with https://. We care about the status code sent by the impersonated web
            server.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Use --proxy-header when using a CGI prefix with https:// and a "Host:" header.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Allow '|' in tokens and values to allow tag patterns like
            "TAG:^(application|text)/(x-)?javascript$".</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>When get_cgi_page_or_else() fails, include the URL of the requested page in the log message.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Added a --check-bad-ssl option that can be used to verify that Privoxy detects certificate problems when
            accessing the test sites from badssl.com.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Bumped version to 0.7.2</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>uagen:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Update example output.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Recommend the use of the https-inspection action in the documentation.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Upgrade a couple of URLs to https://.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Add ElectroBSD to the list of operating systems.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Bumped generated Firefox version to 78 (ESR).</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Bumped version to 1.2.2.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>User documentation:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Remove reference to 'How to Report Bugs Effectively'. It was only rendered as text without URL in the
            README anyway and there's no indication that users read it ...</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Let the dok-readme target fix the location embedded into the README file. This used to be done by CVS
            but since the git migration it has to be done through other means.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Remove 'experimental' warning for client-specific-tag-related directives. They seem to work reliably and
            there is no obvious reason why we would change the syntax in the near future.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Describe how to check if Privoxy has been built with FEATURE_HTTPS_INSPECTION.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Add a link to the trusted-cas-file documentation that explains how the user can create the file
            herself.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Don't explicitly mention the license for the code coming from 'Anonymous Coders' and Junkbusters. It's
            obviously licensed under the GNU GPL like the rest of Privoxy or we wouldn't be allowed to distribute
            it.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Update the +hide-user-agent example with uagen output.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Slightly improve the wording of the ca-key-file documentation.</p>
          </li>

      <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="UPGRADERSNOTE" id="UPGRADERSNOTE">3.1. Note to Upgraders</a></h2>
      <p>A quick list of things to be aware of before upgrading from earlier versions of <span class=
      "APPLICATION">Privoxy</span>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The recommended way to upgrade <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> is to backup your old
          configuration files, install the new ones, verify that <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> is working
          correctly and finally merge back your changes using <span class="APPLICATION">diff</span> and maybe
          <span class="APPLICATION">patch</span>.</p>
          <p>There are a number of new features in each <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> release and most of
          them have to be explicitly enabled in the configuration files. Old configuration files obviously don't do
          that and due to syntax changes using old configuration files with a new <span class=
          "APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> isn't always possible anyway.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Note that some installers remove earlier versions completely, including configuration files, therefore you
          should really save any important configuration files!</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>On the other hand, other installers don't overwrite existing configuration files, thinking you will want
          to do that yourself.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>In the default configuration only fatal errors are logged now. You can change that in the <a href=
          "config.html#DEBUG">debug section</a> of the configuration file. You may also want to enable more verbose
          logging until you verified that the new <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> version is working as
          expected.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Three other config file settings are now off by default: <a href=
          "config.html#ENABLE-REMOTE-TOGGLE">enable-remote-toggle</a>, <a href=
          "config.html#ENABLE-REMOTE-HTTP-TOGGLE">enable-remote-http-toggle</a>, and <a href=
          "config.html#ENABLE-EDIT-ACTIONS">enable-edit-actions</a>. If you use or want these, you will need to
          explicitly enable them, and be aware of the security issues involved.</p>
