          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>General improvements:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Added experimental https inspection support which allows to filter https traffic. To enable it, install
            MbedTLS and configure with --with-mbedtls, or install OpenSSL or LibreSSL and configure with
            --with-openssl. Afterwards configure the directives in section 7 of the config file and enable the
            +https-inspection action. Initial MbedTLS-based code contributed by Vaclav Svec, initial OpenSSL support
            contributed by Maxim Antonov. With help from Nedzad Hrnjica and Ho+ Ho+ Ho+. Integration and improvements
            sponsored by Robert Klemme.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>pcrs: Request JIT compilation if it's supported and the filter isn't dynamic. This can speed up
            filtering.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Added support for Brotli decompression. Sponsored by: Robert Klemme</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Added FEATURE_EXTENDED_STATISTICS to gather statistics for block reasons and filter executions. To
            enable it, configure with --enable-extended-statistics and visit http://config.privoxy.org/show-status.
            Sponsored by: Robert Klemme</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Use the IP_FREEBIND socket option, if defined. This allows Privoxy to bind to not-yet assigned IP
            addresses which is useful in failover environments. Patch by Sam Varshavchik.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Allow to use extended host patterns and vanilla host patterns at the same time by prefixing extended
            host patterns with "PCRE-HOST-PATTERN:". To enable this, configure with --enable-pcre-host-patterns.
            Sponsored by: Robert Klemme</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Added "Cross-origin resource sharing" (CORS) support. This allows to access Privoxy's CGI interface via
            JavaScript from another domain (white-listed with the new cors-allowed-origin directive). Based on a patch
            by Nedzad Hrnjica. Sponsored by: Robert Klemme.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Add SOCKS5 username/password support. Based on a patch by Sam, improved by Ivan Romanov. Closes
            Patch#141 and solves TODO#105.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Bump the maximum number of action and filter files to 100 each. Sponsored by: Robert Klemme</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Fixed handling of filters with "split-large-forms 1" when using the CGI editor. Reported by withoutname
            in #921.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Better detect a mismatch of connection details when figuring out whether or not a connection can be
            reused.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Don't send a "Connection failure" message instead of the "DNS failure" message. Sponsored by: Robert
            Klemme</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Let LOG_LEVEL_REQUEST log all requests. Previously unencrypted requests were only logged with
            LOG_LEVEL_REQUEST when they weren't crunched (in which case they were logged with LOG_LEVEL_CRUNCH). This
            was documented behaviour, but logging all requests seems more useful.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Fixed locking around localtime() and gmtime().</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Removed OS/2 support. We haven't provided OS/2 packages in years, it complicated the code and it
            depended on a fallback snprintf() implementation which is GPLv2 only.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Remove the fallback snprintf() implementation Now that OS/2 support is gone we no longer need it.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Fixed a bunch of format specifiers log messages.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Added a missing apostrophe in the 'More Privoxy' menu.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Explicitly prevent use of FEATURE_CONNECTION_SHARING without FEATURE_CONNECTION_KEEP_ALIVE. It makes no
            sense and does not compile anyway. Sponsored by: Robert Klemme</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Fix build without FEATURE_CONNECTION_KEEP_ALIVE. Sponsored by: Robert Klemme</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Downgrade the 'Graceful termination requested' message to LOG_LEVEL_INFO as it isn't an error. Sponsored
            by: Robert Klemme</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>decompress_iob(): Downgrade the no-content message to LOG_LEVEL_RE_FILTER While at it, fix a typo in a
            comment. Sponsored by: Robert Klemme</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Fixed a couple of cppcheck warnings.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Rename LOG_LEVEL_GPC to LOG_LEVEL_REQUEST. Only the shadow knows what "GPC" is supposed to stand
            for.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Remove SourceForge references in copyright headers.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Upgrade a bunch of links to the homepage to https://.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Add 'no-brotli-accepted' filter which prevents the use of Brotli compression.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Changed license for pcrs to GPLv2+ after getting the permission from Andreas. This allows to
            redistribute Privoxy under the GPLv3 which is required when linking to future mbedTLS versions which are
            expected to be licensed under the Apache 2.0 license only.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Updated a bunch of tests that have to expect status code 403 now after r1.168/070e904afa5.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Lowercase the host name in the request line.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Only set SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH if it's not already set so distributions can overwrite it through the
            environment.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Documentation changes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Explain that Privoxy has to be distributed under the GPLv3 (or later) when linked with an MbedTLS
            version that is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Import the GNU GPLv3 and include it the user manual.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Clarify FEATURE_FORCE_LOAD's description. It allows to bypass blocking not filtering and only does it if
            blocks aren't enforced. Reported by: Robert Klemme</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>FAQ: Remove Zwiebelfreunde e.V. from the list of fiduciary sponsors As of 2021 they no longer handle
            donations for foreign organisations due to lack of resources.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>FAQ: Add a link to the TODO list.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>FAQ: Change the sponsor amounts to USD slightly rounding the converted amounts up to get simple numbers.
            Receiving USD is apparently easier for SPI and SPI is preferred by sponsors as they can send invoices.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Advertise the client-tags CGI page in the user manual.</p>
          </li>

          </li>
          <li>

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Don't claim that contributors need ssh. It's only needed for committers.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Replace obsolete CVS instructions with Git instructions.</p>

      <li>
        <p>Config file changes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Change the suggested default-server-timeout to 5 to match the suggested keep-alive-timeout. Otherwise
            using the defaults would result in Privoxy reducing the default-server-timeout and logging an error
            message. Sponsored by: Robert Klemme</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Update the 'debug 1' description.</p>
          </li>
          <li>

      <p>A quick list of things to be aware of before upgrading from earlier versions of <span class=
      "APPLICATION">Privoxy</span>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The recommended way to upgrade <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> is to backup your old
          configuration files, install the new ones, verify that <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> is working
          correctly and finally merge back your changes using <span class="APPLICATION">diff</span> and maybe
          <span class="APPLICATION">patch</span>.</p>
          <p>There are a number of new features in each <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> release and most of
          them have to be explicitly enabled in the configuration files. Old configuration files obviously don't do
          that and due to syntax changes using old configuration files with a new <span class=
          "APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> isn't always possible anyway.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Note that some installers remove earlier versions completely, including configuration files, therefore you
          should really save any important configuration files!</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>On the other hand, other installers don't overwrite existing configuration files, thinking you will want
          to do that yourself.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>In the default configuration only fatal errors are logged now. You can change that in the <a href=
          "config.html#DEBUG">debug section</a> of the configuration file. You may also want to enable more verbose
          logging until you verified that the new <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> version is working as
          expected.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Three other config file settings are now off by default: <a href=
          "config.html#ENABLE-REMOTE-TOGGLE">enable-remote-toggle</a>, <a href=
          "config.html#ENABLE-REMOTE-HTTP-TOGGLE">enable-remote-http-toggle</a>, and <a href=
          "config.html#ENABLE-EDIT-ACTIONS">enable-edit-actions</a>. If you use or want these, you will need to
          explicitly enable them, and be aware of the security issues involved.</p>
