><P
>      Added support for client-specific tags which allow Privoxy
      admins to pre-define tags that are set for all requests from
      clients that previously opted in through the CGI interface.
      They are useful in multi-user setups where admins may
      want to allow users to disable certain actions and filters
      for themselves without affecting others.
      In single-user setups they are useful to allow more fine-grained
      toggling. For example to disable request blocking while still
      crunching cookies, or to disable experimental filters only.
      This is an experimental feature, the syntax and behaviour may
      change in future versions.

>      Dynamic filters and taggers now support a $listen-address variable

   You can change that in the <A

   of the configuration file. You may also want to enable more verbose
   logging until you verified that the new <SPAN
